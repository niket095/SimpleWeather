# SimpleWeather

The Weather app is a simple and convenient tool for getting upâ€”to-date weather information in your region or in any other city in the world. It uses the OpenWeather API to get real-time weather data and provides users with the ability to easily track weather changes.

### Main functions:

- Automatic location detection: The first time the app is launched, it requests permission to access the user's location and automatically displays the current weather in their region. This allows you to quickly get information without having to enter data.

- City Selection: Users can manually enter the name of the city to get weather information in any other location. This makes the app versatile and convenient for travelers or those who want to monitor the weather in other regions.

- Intuitive interface: The application has a simple and intuitive interface that allows users to quickly find the information they need. All weather data is presented in a convenient format, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of weather conditions.

### The project uses:
- Swift
